# Tender
Swipe for the best matched recipe!

Tender is a humorous recipe suggestion app that plays off of mobile-based dating app interfaces. Tender takes in user dietary preferences and restrictions with an initial survey, and uses that information to generate potential matches with the Spoonify API. Users can then match to find the recipe of their dreams!
